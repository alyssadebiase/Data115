# Orca Populations Over Twenty Years
### Alyssa Debiase

## Motivation
Being from the Puget Sound area, I was always interested in sea life. Originally, I was planning to do a much more broad study of endangered animal populations around the globe, but I recently watched the documentary “Blackfish” and that is where I got the idea to research orca populations.I know that orcas are being hunted and killed every year all across the globe which made me interested in what the actual numbers of their populations are. I chose to do data from the last 20 years because I wanted to see how the orca population changed throughout my life time. As a child I remember going to the cove near me and watching the orca pods migrate through the sounds and being amazed.

## Data Process
I started my process researching extinct animals and found thousands of data all across the web that correlated to different animals across the globe that had/ were going extinct. The dates also went back thousands of years and none of it was interesting to me. I then looked up orca population data and found a graph on https://www.whaleresearch.com/orca-population where i turned all the data into columns and numbers on excel. After that i started cleaning up the data and focused on the last 20 years and put it into excel. I then made a  5 plot summary of each orca pod in R to get a rough idea of what the minimum and maximum of thepopulation. After that I made another excel sheet focusing on the JKL pod data (because it was all the pods in one set) and the last 20 years. I made a scatter plot to see the trend in numbers of the population vs. the year. I then went even further with the data process and put a linear regression line to see the trend of the numbers.
