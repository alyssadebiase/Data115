### Alyssa Debiase

## Motivation
Being from the Puget Sound area, I was always interested in sea life. Originally, I was planning to do a much more broad study of endangered animal populations around the globe, but I recently watched the documentary “Blackfish” and that is where I got the idea to research orca populations.
