# Orca Populations Over Twenty Years
### Alyssa Debiase

## Motivation
Being from the Puget Sound area, I was always interested in sea life. Originally, I was planning to do a much more broad study of endangered animal populations around the globe, but I recently watched the documentary “Blackfish” and that is where I got the idea to research orca populations.

## Data Process

## Visualization

This figure is a scatter plot showing orca populations for the years 2000-2020. There is a clear negative trend through the last twenty years. The total population counted in 2020
